# SCI6485-3dgan-pytorch
Harvard GSD SCI6485 project by Qing Feng and Xiying Bao

# Introduction
This repo is an implementation of 3dgan in Pytorch. Link to the original paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.07584.pdf \n
Our goal for this project is to generate clothes of orgranic form, and this 3dgan model serves as a building block in our pipeline. We basically replicated the model exactly as presented in the paper and trained on a dataset of voxelized clothes.\n
